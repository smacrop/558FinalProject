# 558FinalProject

### The purpose of this app is to investigate the predictor variables in our housing dataset and to predict house prices based on several chosen predictors. The Housing csv file is listed also in this repository!

##### We will need the following packages: shiny, caret, tidyverse, and DT. 

```
install.packages("shiny", "caret", "tidyverse", "DT")
library(shiny)
library(caret)
library(tidyverse)
library(DT)
```
