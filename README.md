### The purpose of this app is to investigate the predictor variables in our housing dataset and to predict house prices based on several chosen predictors. 

##### We will need the following packages: shiny, caret, tidyverse, and DT. 

```
install.packages("shiny", "caret", "tidyverse", "DT")
library(shiny)
library(caret)
library(tidyverse)
library(DT)
```
